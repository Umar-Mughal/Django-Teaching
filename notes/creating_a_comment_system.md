# Creating a Comment System

We will continue extending our blog application with a comment system that will allow users to comment on posts. To build the comment system, we will need the following:

- A comment **model** to store user comments on posts
- A **form** that allows users to submit comments and manages the data validation


- A **view** that processes the form and saves a new comment to the database

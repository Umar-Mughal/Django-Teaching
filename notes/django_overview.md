# Django Overview

Django is a framework consisting of a set of components that solve common web development problems. 

# Main framework components

Django follows the MTV (Model-Template-View) pattern. It is a slightly similar pattern to the wellknown MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

The responsibilities in the Django MTV pattern are divided as follows:

• Model – Defines the logical data structure and is the data handler between the database and
the View

• Template – Is the presentation layer

• View – Communicates with the database via the Model and transfers the data to the Template
for viewing.

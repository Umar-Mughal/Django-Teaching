# Django Forms

Django has a built-in forms framework that allows you to create forms easily. The forms framework makes it simple to define the fields of the form, specify how they have to be displayed, and indicate how they have to validate input data.

Django comes with two base classes to build forms:

- **Form**: Allows you to build standard forms by defining fields and validations. 
- **ModelForm**: Allows you to build forms tied to model instances. It provides all the functionalities of the base Form class, but form fields can be explicitly declared, or automatically generated, from model fields.

# Django Views Overview

Now that you understand how to use the **ORM**, you are ready to build the views of the blog application. A Django view is just a Python function that receives a web request and returns a web response. All the logic to return the desired response goes inside the view. 

First, you will create your application views, then you will define a **URL** pattern for each view, and finally, you will create HTML templates to render the data generated by the views. Each view will render a template, passing variables to it, and will return an HTTP response with the rendered output.
